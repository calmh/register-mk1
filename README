Register
========

Register is a web application to keep track of a network of martial arts clubs.
It is primarily written for Five Animals in Sweden, http://www.fiveforms.org/,
but could be used for any similar organization.

It is currently in Swedish, but an internationalization project is under way
and will hopefully be completed during the fall of 2009. Register runs under
IIS with .NET 2.0 or under Apache with mod_mono, which is our production
platform and therefore the most tested configuration.

Data is stored in a simple XML file and is cached in-memory for performance.
This makes it easy to do database backups and integrate the information with
other tools, such as mailing list handlers.
