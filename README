Register
========

Register is a web application to keep track of a network of martial arts clubs.
It is primarily written for Five Animals in Sweden, http://www.fiveforms.org/,
but could be used for any similar organization.

********************************************************************************
* It is currently in a state where it's most likely not usable to anyone else, *
* due to assumptions and hard coded rules. It is also mostly in Swedish.       *

However, there is an internationalization and cleanup project is under way
which will hopefully be completed during the fall of 2009.

Register runs under IIS with .NET 2.0 or under Apache with mod_mono, which is
our production platform and therefore the most tested configuration. Data is
stored in a simple XML file and is cached in-memory for performance.  This
makes it easy to do database backups and integrate the information with other
tools, such as mailing list handlers.
